# Envelope Budgeting API

Node/Express API with auth flow to manage a portfolio budget using a budget envelope strategy. Users can create, read, update, and delete envelopes as well as create transactions for each individual envelope. All data is persisted in a database using PostgreSQL.

This project was built as part of my personal portfolio.

It helped me solidify the knowledge regarding concepts and technologies such as:
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Auth flow (authentication, authorization, jwt)
- Security concerns: XSS attacks and CSRF protection
- TDD: (jest, supertest)
- MVC architecture
- among other things
